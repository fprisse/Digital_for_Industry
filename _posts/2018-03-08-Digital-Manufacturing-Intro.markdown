#### Using today's technologies to optimise manufacturing

The manufacturing industry is ready to embark on a truly digial transformation journey along a relatively unbeaten track. It is at the brink of embracing game-changing developments in the fields of computing power, connectivity,advanced analytics, robotics, and one-off production technology. When devising the way forward, there are several other influencing factors, such as the rise of a new generation of operational staff and the shortening of product life cycles. Furthermore, extensive automation and expanding supplier–buyer networks bring a whole new level of complexity to the shop floor. This requires the capability to work with a rapid succession of changing specifications and demands.

Digital manufacturing is the act of embracing the opportunities of such technologies to reinvent the way we run, maintain,and improve production facilities, thereby optimally addressing the classic themes of core manufacturing functions that include quality, performance, and asset reliability in the contemporary playing field. The realms of Industry 4.0 also provide a transformation roadmap for PLM and supply chain; however,in this chapter we focus on the areas that have direct shop floor implications with an aim to optimise production and overall asset performance.



#### Operational Intelligence: Using Data to take Lean to the next level.

Operating a modern production facility is probably one of the most complex jobs in the industry. Over the last decades, a number of techniques have been developed to deal with this complexity, mostly by eliminating it. Years of improving techniques such as "Just in Time"

[^JIT]: Just in Time is a simple and visual method of managing flows in a factory with minimal inventory,sometimes less than an hour’s worth of production. JIT increases the visibility of buffer inventories that are reserved for production problems. This allows any operator to stop the line when encountering a problem. This in turn“forces” a culture of understanding and eliminating the root cause of problems.

 and "Single minute exchange die"

[^SMED]: Single Minute Exchange of Dies is another simple method to eliminate the second cause of non-productivity—production change-overs. Initially developed for heavy stamping presses to change the die, SMED helps to prepare for frequent tooling changes required to switch from one product to another and allows to execute the change itself in under one minute.

 have converged into “Lean Manufacturing”. A Lean plant is a precise choreography, regularly churning out products. It does, However, it struggles today to cope with smaller lot sizes of increasingly personalized products.

> The combination of increased complexity of production technologies and the exploding variety of products has driven the low-tech beauty of Lean to its limit.

In the past, the number of variables had to be reduced in order to identify the relation between material specs, recipes, machine settings, and other factors. With today's data gathering capabilities and analytical tooling one does not need to put pad-locks on dials to flesh out the causal relationships. A modern data-infrastructure can easily capture multidimensional variation. This variation is today considered desirable from an statistical point of view.

With advanced machine-learning techniques, we can derive insights from a multidimensional dataset (with up to a 1,000 variables). Such correlations, once identified, can be used to predict quality scores and the likelihood of machine failure. Herewith production boundaries and maintenance regimes can be improved, and compensatory actions designed. This ultimately leads to considerable improvement in uptime and quality.

The critical aspect is to connect and combine data across the different stages in the production process, including process parameters, machine state, and product state.

Prerequisites for getting here include: cross-discipline data availability, objective quality assessment, and product and component traceability.



#### Industrial IoT Deployment: Taking it beyond proof of concept.

After experimenting with IoT technology in proof-of-concept projects, most manufacturing companies are now convinced that Industrial IoT and Digital Manufacturing can indeed deliver the next wave of performance improvement. Such experiments have helped skepticism about digital technologies that were already creating value in other industries. We need to ask ourselves if we have been testing the right things. What often still investigation within the specific circumstances of your factory is how:

1. Cost effectively deploy sensors, connectivity and aggregation at plant scale

5. Build or buy the analytical capability to distil actionable insights

3. Implement these insights in daily Operations and Maintenance regimes.



#### Taking Digital Manufacturing to the core of your operation.

With digital technologies helping you gauge, connect, analyse, and report,  we still have ground to cover. At Capgemini, we believe that in order to truly reap the fruits of today's opportunities, a fundamental change is needed in how we govern and steer production facilities.

This calls for a fundamental change: The pre-designed process and its accompanying assumptions should no longer be centric in our exploratory trails for improvement. The statistical relationships found in the data that it brings forth can now be our guide. Digital Manufacturing (just like Kaizen) iii is still about the systematic discovery of performance enhancers and inhibitors. However, we need no longer depend on trial by error.

> Traditional (rear view) Business Intelligence needs to come out of IT departments to the shop floor and evolve into forward looking “Operational Intelligence”

This changes the manner of measuring success at every level from plant management down to operator level. The predictive value that we can now attribute to the full breadth of data must here for impact daily decision making. Decisions that aim to optimize the likelihood of desirable outcomes, thereby steering to stay within the boundaries that have proven to produce the required level of performance and quality.
Thus, making data driven assessment, and acting upon it, a shop floor activity.

#### Systems & Infrastructure:

Data collection from an entire factory and its environment will increase the complexity multi-fold. To aggregate and analyse data (preferably in real time) from disparate equipment as well as production tracking systems and enterprise applications
  demands that we start seeking a befitting architecture. Or rather find a befitting manner to define and design it for your specific company.

> Far from being an enabler, the technology – todays IT/OT gap in particular – is a major hurdle for the adoption of Digital Manufacturing techniques

This does not necessarily call for a big-bang solution. A stepped approach can be a good choice, keeping pace  with the speed at which your company can deploy new ways of working:

![Next generation MES](/images/DM-Intro-3.png)

1.   Pre-defined datasets are collected based upon identified issues and targeted improvement areas. This limits the amount of data, collected by the control system, which is loosely connected with the enterprise level, via bespoke operations applications.

2. A combination of MES platform and analytics/Big Data tools (such as Braincube, Azure, IBM Cloud) : IoT makes it possible to connect a large amount of production data, bypassing the control systems, and combine it with contextual data into more powerful operational analytics.
3. An integrated platform: Over time, the "IoT hub" becomes the platform on which intergrated operations are built, leveraging open and flexible IT tools. Thus allowing for the “smartness of others” to be incorporated at speed.

> Deploying Digital Manufacturing will challenge both enterprise architects and automation experts
> to invent a new operations “stack” converging IT and OT technologies.

For the integrated design there are multiple viable scenario's. Success will require a new level of collaboration between IT and Operations to design a road map assuring business continuity. Striking a good balance between integration to overcome the interfluvial divide and maintaining some level of system-independent operability.



We work with you in a fast and non-disruptive manner to deploy sensor, connectivity, and aggregation initiatives at scale, serving your operations and industrial assets with contemporary tools and methodology to improve uptime, performance, and quality. At the same time, we leverage our deep understanding of your operations to collaborate with CIO and COO and design an architecture that truly integrates data-based operations management.
