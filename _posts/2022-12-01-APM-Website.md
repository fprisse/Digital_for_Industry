APM is part of the Digital Manufacturing Suite of Solutions developed by Capgemini Group. Digital Manufacturing is the act of using contemporary technology to reinvent the way we run, maintain, and improve production facilities. Thereby optimally addressing the classic themes of core manufacturing functions, namely: asset reliability, operational performance and product quality. 

## Asset-intensive organizations today 

Organizations in asset-intensive industries such as Utilities, Manufacturing, Transportation and Gas and Oil are currently facing the following challenges: 

- The end of Lifetime Employment: Trusting on “Tribal knowledge” is not without risks 

- Legacy systems: Aged machinery does not easily befit the hunger for getting more relatable data out of production systems 
- Return for Industry 4.0 investments: Manufacturers seek for a structured industry 4.0 approach 

## Capgemini brings fit-for-purpose APM approach 

Asset Performance Management (APM) is not one thing, it is a set of well-orchestrated capabilities, namely: data capturing, data aggregation, advanced analytics and visualisation. Tied together with the primary goal of optimising reliability and availability of physical assets and/or reducing maintenance cost in a more data-driven manner and making use of advanced analytics for failure-mode modelling to improve maintenance regimes. 

With Capgemini's approach you will bring the capabilities of APM to a part of the business that is inherently on premises and away from the desktop. Capgemini’s approach can be divided into three main areas: 

Firstly, providing a more accurate view upon the state of your asset and its components by: 

- Capturing data that before were outside the AM realm from Operations and Supply Chain. 
- Taking in measurements that were before used only as a threshold value. 
- Using contextual data and data from additional sensors (industrial IoT). 

Secondly, building a maintenance and asset management organization that enables you to act in a systemic manner. Creating a more stable and predictable environment allows you to optimize your maintenance activities based on the enhanced insights. 

And thirdly, Capgemini and its partner network provide a suite of APM solutions for: 

- Sensors & connectivity 
- Aggregation 
- Advanced analytics 

- Visualisation

APM also provides a guideline for improving the static data framework: To allow for wear and use data to be incorporated, maintenance regimes, equipment criticality and internal dependencies should be documented in a shared asset registry. 

 

## Clear focus on ROI 

APM creates the following business value and benefits: 

- Uptime: Primarily APM is focussed on the optimise maintenance cycles to increase uptime and avoid asset related performance degradation. This is realised by pre-emptive replacement of components at peril, but also by orchestrated downtime by combining upcoming work on dependent assets. 

- Maintenance Cost: Advanced analytics, data mining and data visualisation tools enable engineers to identify real root causes and develop ideal corrective action plans faster and more effectively. 
- Reliable Production: Fewer unplanned disruptions due to equipment breakdowns increases your OEE and means you can consistently meet production targets. 
- Help comply with regulations: E.g. ISO 55001. 

 

## In close orchestration with other (legacy) systems 

APM takes on board a wide breath to improve asset performance. This includes maintenance planning and execution data; it does however not replace EAM or AIP Solutions. 

APM	APM is designed for data-driven decision making and planning to realise safe, reliable, and efficient operation of equipment and infrastructure 

EAM	Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) is designed for maintenance execution. A two-way link between the two is key for 1) Using maintenance execution history to gauge likelihood of failure 2) To trigger the creation or re-scheduling of work-orders 

AIP	Asset Investment Planning (AIP) AIP takes data on asset condition, maintenance costs, criticality, budgets and risks, to produce a CAPEX forecast for asset replacement or decommissioning 

 

## Scalable: Big means small too 

Next trends ….. 

- The availability of cloud-based, commoditized tooling makes APM available at pay-per-use pricing models. By joining a cloud-based APM solution you can cover 90% of your assets, before investing in dedicated asset solutions. More customized tooling for those unique parts of your operation can be invested in once your organization is in a more mature phase. 
- More cross-global integration, leveraging data and patterns from other plants.  

 

## Start today 

Typically, an APM journey is kicked-off with an Asset Maturity Assessment within your organization and an initial goal setting in terms of APM sophistication. In an eight-week period we will work with your people to set realistic targets and timelines and estimate returns and efforts of the realisation. This encompasses an evaluation of the AM Organization, Processes, Maintenance regimes, Contract Management andsupporting Data Infrastructure and Performance Management.

 *In 2020 more than 60% of asset-intensive organizations will use APM tools (Gartner, 2018).* 

*Improving asset performance helps organizations not only reduce costs, but also keep production plans on track while catering to end demands. According to a McKinsey research report, improved asset efficiency will contribute to an incremental value of more than $250 billion in the U.S. by 2025.*
