### My comments:

It skips the step that connects it to the business issues that our clients are facing

technology push / business pull = innovation / solution (what is the mechanism ?)

a arbitrary selection of technologies use cases etc. Gives you an peak rather tahn a comprehensive overview: However it contains a list people that may be relevant to pick our exercise up with.

Helps us connect to the relevant people & communities

These people know about the technology it seems and the trends but fail to connect: the **SO WHAT DO I DO NOW ? QUESTION DOES NOT GET ADDRESSED**

It also helps us to find out what questions we need to answer:

 - What is "going digital" ?
 - Consumerisation of Corporate IT : consumer habits influencing workplace


**Understand the "PILOT" offering.**

Need to:

1) make an overview of what we want to offer ()
2) see what we have allready in house
3) make a first overview for people to challenge (what i have is better)
4) test with trusted customers

## Introduction and Agenda

This Starter Pack aims at giving you a first bunch of documents, Group references and feedbacks around Internet of Things. The objective is not to present a perfect state of the art or inventory of Capgemini references, but to provide you a first level of inputs, contacts and reusable content on similar projects,in order to accelerate and improve your entry in this domain and help you on your project / proposal.

It gathers many feedbacks from the Architects Community, as well as some general documents (Capgemini or external) on IoT.



Onekey point to support this sharing approach around each Top Trend is to build a Subject Matter Experts (SME) Network

In this objective, we created the following mailing list: [archi -sme -iot@capgemini.com](mailto:archi -sme -iot@capgemini.com)

All contributors to this Starter Pack have been already added to this mailing list. If you also work on an IoT project, or have some expertise that you can share on this topic, please [advise us to add you in this list](mailto:adrien.calvayrac@capgemini.com -%20fabien.gioe@capgemini.com?subject=Please%20add%20me%20to%20the%20SME%20CyberSecurity%20mailing%20list).

### Introduction to IoT ?

The Internet of Things is creating a new world, a quantifiable and measureable world, where people and businesses can manage their assets in better informed ways, and can make more timely and better informed decisions about what they want or need to do. This new connected world brings with it fundamental changes to company, to society and to consumers. IoT is able to make better informed, more accurate and more timely decisions - and decisions that will improve lives, save money, and transform business models. The IoT will make <u>the</u> difference.

We, Capgemini, offer an <u>integrated and solution based approach</u> to <u>achieve business strateg</u>y and to <u>align IT</u> and <u>Operations</u> through <u>Consulting Innovation approach</u> and <u>Technology expertise</u>

### Sogeti CBIoT Platform : Cockpit for Big System (CBS): The First Step

Historically CBS started with the need to control -command and manage Very Large Systems of Systems (~100K machines) in the IT area, with a much larger number of assets  (~20 managed assets per machine) and Ultra Large Scale System as final target (more than 1 million machines ~20 million assets).  

Our concerns were:
 - Efficient functioning with the same quality at different scales
 - Inherent heterogeneity of management of assets and diversity of modes to communicate with each others
 - Adjustment to the fine granularity of information in order to follow in real time the business needs
 - Orchestration control of the systems of systems

Note:
 - We built a generic infrastructure system, adaptable to business needs, and to use cases.
 - CBS is OK with VLSS, but we are still running at the ULSS.
 - We need more scalability, elasticity and fast application development for experiments.

 - Home automation
 - Transport (ongoing prospection)
 - Smart Building (see Image)

### Sogeti CBIoT Platform : Smart Buildings

Image: IoT_CBS_SmartBuilding.PNG  

#### Main Principles:
Distributed control system for the building management system
Provides improvements of different fields: environmental, personal, cost, environmental, etc.
 - Occupant comfort
 - Efficient operation of building systems
 - Reduction in energy consumption
 - Reduction of operating and maintenance costs
 - Lifecycle of utilities
 - Combines several types of sensors and actuators
 - Involves different kind of interfaces, devices, and software

**CBIoTS and Smart Building**
 - Handles millions of sensors and actuators  -> management of several buildings, for the building management but also the people
 - Distributed, direct access to the platform to take global decision, have an overview
 - Use of a gateway to take local decision, and pre -filter the data
 - Different level of control, permissions: local and global building management policy, keep control of sensitive data and their sharing
