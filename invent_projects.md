## ADD 1: PROJECT SUMMARIES @ CAPGEMINI INVENT

2019 - 2020 LambWeston-Meyer
Industry 4.0 roadmap the work included a capability assessment,  volumetric modelling and a high level level business case.

2018 - 2020 : Global practice lead Asset Performance Management
Design of the suite of solutions for data-driven Asset Management for Capgemini Group: This is done in close cooperation with our main customers and trusted suppliers. Based on our project experience in maintenance & asset management, we defined a cross-disciplinary approach to plan and execute the implementation of Asset Performance Management for our clients. This includes a step-by-step implementation programme covering asset registry, planning and execution tracking, condition monitoring and asset health analysitics.

2017 : DSM Nutritional Products, Switzerland & India
DSM's centralised P2P organisation was struggling to serve DSM Nutritional Products (DNP) to satisfaction. Rather than fix the individual issues, we looked at the P2P workflow from a core-process perspective. Revealing (often easily realised) opportunities for a better match. 

2016 : ProRail, Netherlands
Asset performance management: Implemented analysis and reporting scheme of downtime in two regions (randstad-Noord and Zuid) for the Dutch railway infrastructure; Befitting the performance contracts between ProRail and its contractors.

2015 : Capgemini Consulting, Central Europe
An introduction to business unit strategy: Designed course material and conducted training sessions for young consultants of the strategy and transformation discipline.

2015 : ProRail, Netherlands
Prorail, proprietor of the Dutch railway infrastructure, was facing bad press due to dissatisfactory availability of the infrastructure around Schiphol. We conducted an extensive root-cause-analysis of downtime. Consecutively, based on our findings, we installed a daily planning and reporting workflow to optimise use of available nightly working hours. This included:
	⁃	Joint planning and scheduling with contractors for repairs
	⁃	Tracking of timely inspections and planned maintenance
	⁃	Isolate and escalate process for truly technical issues 
Thus, improving uptime by 21% within 3 months.

2015 : Vopak Antwerpen, Belgium
As part of the integration of three chemical terminals, we aided in modelling the operational demand of current and projected business and thus formed the basis for a organisational re-fit in terms of job attribution and sizing. Consecutively we re-wrote the 5 year Asset Plan and drew up a future staffing plan.

2014 : National Grid, United Kingdom
As part of implementing a new business model I was asked to revise their innovation strategy within the strict boundaries of the UK legislative framework for government funded research.

2012 : Vopak Europoort, Netherlands  
Opex reduction program for the Dutch terminals of Vopak.
	⁃	Maintenance & repairs: Reduced contractor cost by in-sourcing and improving planning and scheduling
	⁃	Operations: Reduced overtime and flex labour cost through improved labour demand prognosis
The success of this undertaking was mostly due to the non-isolated approach of above workstreams.
